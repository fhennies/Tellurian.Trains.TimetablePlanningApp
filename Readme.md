# Timetable Planning App
Web application for working with scheduling of model railway operation at module meetings.
## Work in progress
I have prioritized functions for printing from local Microsoft Access planning database through a WEB API. 
By implementing all printing in this manner, I get short time benefints in better printing from Access, and a WEB API interface which later can be supported by the cloud solution with only minor changes to the printing logic. 

The current printing is now production ready.
- Loco schedules
- Trainset schedules
