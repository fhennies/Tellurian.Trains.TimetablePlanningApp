# Timetable Planning App
Web application for working with scheduling of model railway operation at module meetings.
## Work in progress
I have prioritized functions for printing from local Microsoft Access planning database through a WEB API. 
By implementing all printing in this manner, I get a short time benefit in better printing from my Access database, and a WEB API interface for the printing app, which later can be supported by the cloud solution with only minor changes to the printing logic. 

The current printing is now production ready.
- Loco schedules
- Trainset schedules
